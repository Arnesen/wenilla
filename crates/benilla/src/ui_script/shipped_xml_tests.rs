//! modules structurally cannot give, since each of those loads only the file it is about.

/// EVERY shipped `assets/ui/*.xml` parses — not just the ones a window test happens to load.
///
/// The per-window tests each load their own file, which left real holes: `CraftFrame.xml` and
/// `TradeSkillFrame.xml` ship in [`super::load_default_ui`]'s manifest and had NO parse coverage at
/// all, because the manifest is an inline array no test walks. A malformed comment in either (XML
/// forbids `--` inside `<!-- -->`, which a prose edit hits easily) would have reached a real run
/// untouched by a green suite.
///
/// Deliberately parse-only, not `loader::load`: loading one file out of manifest order reports
/// legitimate errors for templates its predecessors define, so a load-sweep would have to duplicate
/// the load order to say anything. Parsing is order-free and catches the whole well-formedness
/// class on its own.
