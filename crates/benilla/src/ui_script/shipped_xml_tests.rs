/// legitimate errors for templates its predecessors define, so a load-sweep would have to duplicate
/// the load order to say anything. Parsing is order-free and catches the whole well-formedness

/// TextureFrame after the bars and leaned on the retired key's insertion-order tie-break — so both

/// the draw layer alone orders — and found no third instance; the surviving 45 pairs were all
/// benign (action-bar and bag-slot chrome adjacency, text over art, and a bar fill over its own
